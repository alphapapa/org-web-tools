[[https://melpa.org/#/org-web-tools][file:https://melpa.org/packages/org-web-tools-badge.svg]] [[https://stable.melpa.org/#/org-web-tools][file:https://stable.melpa.org/packages/org-web-tools-badge.svg]]

This file contains library functions and commands useful for retrieving web page content and processing it into Org-mode content.

For example, you can copy a URL to the clipboard or kill-ring, then run a command that downloads the page, isolates the "readable" content with =eww-readable=, converts it to Org-mode content with Pandoc, and displays it in an Org-mode buffer.  Another command does all of that but inserts it as an Org entry instead of displaying it in a new buffer.

* Installation                                                   :noexport_1:

** Requirements

+  Emacs 25.1 or later.
+  Commands that process HTML into Org require [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]].  *Note:* The output of current Pandoc versions differs substantially from versions that may still be present in stable Linux distros.  If you encounter any issues, please install a more recent version of Pandoc.

** MELPA

If you installed from MELPA, just run one of the [[*Usage][commands]] below.  If you want to use any of the functions in your own code, you should ~(require 'org-web-tools)~.

** Manual

Install [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash.el]], [[https://github.com/tali713/esxml][esxml]], [[https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request][request]], and [[https://github.com/magnars/s.el][s.el]].  Then require this package in your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'org-web-tools)
#+END_SRC

* Usage                                                          :noexport_1:

** Commands

+  =org-web-tools-insert-link-for-url=: Insert an Org-mode link to the URL in the clipboard or kill-ring.  Downloads the page to get the HTML title.
+  =org-web-tools-insert-web-page-as-entry=: Insert the web page for the URL in the clipboard or kill-ring as an Org-mode entry, as a sibling heading of the current entry.
+  =org-web-tools-read-url-as-org=: Display the web page for the URL in the clipboard or kill-ring as Org-mode text in a new buffer, processed with =eww-readable=.
+  =org-web-tools-convert-links-to-page-entries=: Convert all URLs and Org links in current Org entry to Org headings, each containing the web page content of that URL, converted to Org-mode text and processed with =eww-readable=.  This should be called on an entry that solely contains a list of URLs or links.
+  ~org-web-tools-archive-attach~: Download archive of page at URL and attach with =org-attach=. If =VIEW= is non-nil (interactively, with prefix), view the archive immediately after attaching.  If =CHOOSE-FN= is non-nil (interactively, with double-prefix), prompt for the archive function to use.  (See also [[https://github.com/scallywag/org-board][org-board]]).
+  ~org-web-tools-archive-view~: Open Zip file archive of web page. Extracts to a temp directory and opens with ~browse-url-default-browser~.  Note: the extracted files are left on-disk in the temp directory.

** Functions

 These are used in the commands above and may be useful in building your own commands.

+  =org-web-tools--dom-to-html=: Return parsed HTML DOM as an HTML string. Note: This is an approximation and is not necessarily correct HTML (e.g. IMG tags may be rendered with a closing "</img>" tag).
+  =org-web-tools--eww-readable=: Return "readable" part of HTML with title.

+  =org-web-tools--html-title=: Return title of HTML page.
+  =org-web-tools--html-to-org-with-pandoc=: Return string of HTML converted to Org with Pandoc.  When SELECTOR is non-nil, the HTML is filtered using =esxml-query= SELECTOR and re-rendered to HTML with =org-web-tools--dom-to-html=, which see.
+  =org-web-tools--url-as-readable-org=: Return string containing Org entry of URL's web page content.  Content is processed with =eww-readable= and Pandoc.  Entry will be a top-level heading, with article contents below a second-level "Article" heading, and a timestamp in the first-level entry for writing comments.
+  =org-web-tools--demote-headings-below=: Demote all headings in buffer so the highest level is below LEVEL.
+  =org-web-tools--get-first-url=: Return URL in clipboard, or first URL in the kill-ring, or nil if none.
